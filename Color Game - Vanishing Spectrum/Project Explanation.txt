This is a web based color matching game made with web designers and graphics artists in mind.
The game lets the player practice their RGB color identification skills.
The overhead RGB gives values for red, green and blue color concentration.
The player's job is to pick the right color with respect to the given mix from a set of choices.
Enjoy!

Future refinements include a point system, and guessing streak counter. 
Database implementation for storing high scores is also considered.
